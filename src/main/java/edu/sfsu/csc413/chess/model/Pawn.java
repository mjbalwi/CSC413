/**
 * The pawn — the piece that breaks every rule the others follow.
 *
 * <p>It is the only piece that moves in just one direction, the only one whose
 * capture differs from its move, the only one with a special first move, and
 * the only one that turns into something else. It is worth noticing that all of
 * that awkwardness is contained in this one file. No other class in the engine
 * knows that pawns are strange. That containment is the payoff of polymorphism:
 * the irregular case costs one class, not a special case in every method that
 * touches a piece.
 *
 * <p>En passant is not handled here. Like castling, it depends on the previous
 * move rather than on the current board, so it waits for Week 15 when
 * {@code Game} owns the move history.
